Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.


How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

----

Strategy

- Looked this up; using combination formula
  - n!/(k!(n-k)!)
  - where n is the number of squares to traverse
  - k is the number or directions that can be taken per square



Notes:

2x2 grid

Opportunities to go right at first attempt: 2,1,0
Opportunities to go right at second attempt: 2,1,0
Opportunities to go right at third attempt: 2,1,0

Opportunities to go right at first attempt: 2 therefore only 2 down for all attempts
Opportunities to go right at first attempt: 1 therefore either:
- one attempt down
