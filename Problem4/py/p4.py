# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product
# of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#
# Find the largest palindrome made from the
#  product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Strategy
# - Take the max of two, three digit numbers, and
# work backwards to find the first palindrome.
#
# Rules:
# - The products must be 3 digits each

# max number that is the product of two three digit
# numbers

# max three digit number
max_factor = 999

# min factor, based on the candidate rules
min_factor = max_factor % 10 ** (len(str(max_factor)) - 1) + 1

# max product possible
max_product = max_factor ** 2

# # Starting prime
# prime_candidate = 1

# List of discovered primes
primes = []

# List of discovered prime factors
