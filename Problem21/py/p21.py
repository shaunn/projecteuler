# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less
#   than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable
#   pair and each of a and b are called
#   amicable numbers.
#
# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
#   44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
#   The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
#
# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
#
# ---
#
# Strategy
#
# - Find other divisible factor problems I have solved in the past
# - Create the d(n) function
# - Iterate through n to identify d(n) for all numbers under 1000 and plug into dict
# - Iterate through the d(n) dict and find values that match another d(n) key
