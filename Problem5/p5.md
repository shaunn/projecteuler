2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Strategy:
- Identify the highest divisor (20) as the candidate
- Via loop, test the candididate modulus against a decrementing set of divisors
- First fail, increment the candidate by 20
