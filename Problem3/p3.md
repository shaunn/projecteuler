The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

----

Brute force or finesse?

Factor tree?
Identify the first factor, and the next, and break it down?
Divide by two until you can't anymore? Then 3? Then the next prime?

Take a modulo 2 of the number, and if not zero, keep subtracting until it is?
Compile a list of known primes?

Declare/Identify the test number. Call it NUMBER
Identify the first prime, a number that can only be divided by the number 1, or itself. (Hint: It's going to be 2). Call it PRIME

If the PRIME >= NUMBER then stop, because the answer is the last prime calculated. (This should be stored I guess?)
Take NUMBER%PRIME. If it is zero, divide the number by the prime. Store that prime.
LOOP THROUGH THE ABOVE UNTIL module is non-zero!
(Should analysis be performed on the modulus??)

Process each prime, and divide the prime against each quotient

Quotient = Number_sub / Prime

Answer is the largest prime which should be the last quotient

OOOH! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization
Once a factor is known, square it, cube it, and son and see if the number is divisible by it! And stop when it doesn't. Should reduce the number you are analyzing.

Quotient = Number_sub / Prime^x
