The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

1: 1
3: 1,3
6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

Strategy

- Iterate over the equation ((n(n+1))/2) (the triangular number formula) 
- For each triangular number yielded, determine all factors of the number
- Count the number of factors in the triangular number
- If the number of factors is less than 500, increase n+1
- If the number of factors is equal to 500, return the triangular number
