###Digit factorials


145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

Strategy
- There must be some limit where a factorial's product has more digits than the subject input number
    - Instead of fully calculating a factorial, factor it until it completes or exceeds the limit which is the subject number
- Pre-process the factorials of 1 through 9 and create a factorial table
- Iterate the number, break out the digits, and test against table
