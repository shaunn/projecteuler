# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
#
# 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
#
# (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 10^2) = 55^2 = 3025
#
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#   first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is:
# 3025 - 385 = 2640
#
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#   first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# Strategy:
# - Loop from 1 through 100, squaring each
# - Get the sum of all of the squares
# - square the sum

# Define the max number of natural numbers to be processed
natural_max = 10

# Declare the variables important to developing solution
