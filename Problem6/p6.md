The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 10^2) = 55^2 = 3025


Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is:
3025 - 385 = 2640


Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Strategy:
- Loop from 1 through 100, squaring each
- Get the sum of all of the squares
- square the sum

.... Is this too easy?
