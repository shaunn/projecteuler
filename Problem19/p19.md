You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.

Thirty days has September,

April, June and November.

All the rest have thirty-one,

Saving February alone,

Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.

And on leap years, twenty-nine.

A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

Strategy

- Remember: The day of the week is always a 7-day cycle, regardless of year or month. Track separately
- If a century year is not divisible by 400, no leap year. Like 1900
- Loop through every month, then day, then year starting 01JAN1900 and index every day to 31DEC2000
- Map the first of each month with an index value
- Identify the index representing every Sunday
- Find every Sunday that is also the first of the month
